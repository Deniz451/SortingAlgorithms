# Sorting Algorithms

## Description
In this repository you will find my project where i tried to make a simple sorting algorithm visualization using cmd and python.

### Algorithms 
I implemented some of the most famoues sorting algorithms like boggo sort, merge sort, bubble sort and others.

#### Boggo sort
This algorithm is the most basic sorting algorithm out there. How it works is that it takes the given list, shuffels it randomly and if the list is sorted, it returns list, if not, shuffels again. Its avarage sorting time is O(n * n!) which is very, very long. Best case solution tho, it will sort the list on first shuffle.

### Bubble sort
